If we had a way
That always be tomorrow
And if it's all the same
We rather steal and borrow

We're buring like fire
Flames are getting higher
There's a wake desire
Yeah, We're buring up up
We're burning up like fire

Never looking back
And only hold just stall
Those are make to break
So we're crushing
Yeah we're crushing on the ground

We buring like fire
Flames are getting higher
There's a wake desire
Yeah, We're buring up up
We're burning up like fire

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

We buring like fire
Flames are getting higher
There's a wake desire
Yeah, We're buring up up
We're burning up like fire

yeah, fire, woo, woo, woo, like fire
yeah, yeah, like fire
