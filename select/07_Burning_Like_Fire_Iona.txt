There is a path to follow
There is a dream to hold
And there are words of wisdom
For me in this all
I need the truth to guide me
I need a light to fall on me
From Heaven

Burning like fire
Falling like rain
I need to hear your voice again

I am only human, but I have the desire
For Your divine annointing
To start a holy fire
I need the Word to keep me
I need Your love to fall on me
From Heaven

Oh in times of trouble
You will cover me
Oh in times of darkness
You will help me see You
