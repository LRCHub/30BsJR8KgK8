I thought love could be a healer but love just gave me pain
Time just made me wonder, and my pain remains the same
Now that I feel all broken inside and I can't believe
I'm closing my eyes
Tell me where the truth can be found
And heaven must be somewhere around
But I'll carry on, I will keep fighting for
Until the day my restless heart tells me why
Torn - Burning like fire
Torn - Under the pale black moon
Torn - Deepest desires
Torn - Until the moon is rising
I just can't seem to free you, in your eyes I see the sorrow
One day we'll make it, not now I just can't take it
Now that I feel all broken inside and I can't believe
That you are closing your eyes
But I'll carry on, I will keep fighting for
Until the day my restless heart starts to cry
Torn - Burning like fire
Torn - Under the pale black moon
Torn - Deepest desires
Torn - Until the moon is rising
Torn - You keep me burning
Torn - Under the pale black moon
Torn - Deepest desires
Torn - Until the moon is rising
Won't you take me in your arms?
You'll be safe I'll do no harm
Spread your wings of destiny
Now and forever, take my freedom
Into your hands
Torn - Burning like fire
Torn - Under the pale black moon
Torn - Deepest desires
Torn - Until the moon is rising
Torn - Don't abandon my soul
Torn
Torn - Keep it burning
Torn
Torn - Burnt me alive
Torn
Torn - My soul is crying
Torn
Torn - Under the pale black moon
