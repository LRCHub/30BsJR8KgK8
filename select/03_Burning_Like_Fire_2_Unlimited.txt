A: baby come and take me on your natural high
Only you can make me feel the way you do
Baby come and take me on your natural high

Taking me higher!
Burning like fire!
You've got to intoxicate your love

R: my heart starts bouncing, my legs feel weak
My head is turning and it's hard to speak
Floating with my mind on the river of joy
If i'm the player, then your my toy

Without wings, i fly, fly, fly

It feels so hot it burns like fire!
