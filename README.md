> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I just wanna believe you baby
Tell me how do you fly
Where is the place to find
Where is the face of mine
Night flight to venus
I can't believe what I'm
looking for
Nobody see the way
Nobody scream away
People need a reaction baby
Burning
Burning like fire
When I'm running I
chase my dreams
Now I'm flying to
reach the scene
Burning
Burning like fire
When I'm running I
chase my dreams
Now I'm flying to
reach the scene
I don't wanna believe in silence
Feeling out of my mind
I will look up to the sea
My soul and my fireball
Night flight to venus
I can't believe what I'm
looking for
Nobody see the way
Nobody scream away
People need a reaction baby
Burning
Burning like fire
When I'm running I
chase my dreams
Now I'm flying to
reach the scene
Burning
Burning like fire
When I'm running I
chase my dreams
Now I'm flying to
reach the scene
Night flight to venus
I can't believe what I'm
looking for
Nobody see the way
Nobody scream away
People need a reaction baby
Burning
Burning like fire
When I'm running I
chase my dreams
Now I'm flying to
reach the scene
Burning
Burning like fire
When I'm running I
chase my dreams
Now I'm flying to
reach the scene
Burning
Burning like fire
When I'm running I
chase my dreams
Now I'm flying to
reach the scene
Burning
Burning like fire
When I'm running I
chase my dreams
Now I'm flying to
reach the scene
